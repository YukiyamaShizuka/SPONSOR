# Sponsor the Signal Project

Signal is a low-level language designed from scratch in ARM64 assembly, built to support deterministic system execution and future AI-integrated control layers.  
It is the foundation layer of TreeOS — a new kind of operating system where memory, control, and logic are fully transparent and traceable.

## Why Sponsor?

This project is being developed **entirely by an individual**, without institutional funding or hardware sponsorship.  
To continue development — especially writing and testing full assembly on Apple Silicon — the author hopes to acquire:

**A MacBook Air M4 (24GB RAM / 512GB SSD)**  
This will serve as a dedicated development and test device for low-level code in the Signal/TreeOS environment.

In addition, much of the author's creative output — particularly speculative system design and theoretical modeling — arises through extended dialogue with GPT in a handwritten and visual form.  
To support this process, the following tools are also needed:

- **iPad Pro 2024 (13") + Magic Keyboard Folio + Pencil Pro**  
  These will be used for outlining architectures, recording GPT discussions, and managing long-form concept development in a mobile-friendly environment.

Looking further ahead, there may also be a need for a **TreeOS prototype testing workstation**, once the first generation of the system reaches minimum viable form.

## How You Can Help

If you believe in:

- Open architectures that resist black-box logic  
- New computing paradigms beyond traditional UNIX  
- Clean, deterministic system design  

Then your support, no matter how small, helps sustain the effort.

## Transparency

Any funds received will be transparently documented and used exclusively for:

1. Acquiring the above development hardware  
2. Purchasing necessary development tools or compiler licenses (if needed)  
3. Sustaining the author's basic health needs during research  

No donations will be used for entertainment, speculation, or non-project expenses.
