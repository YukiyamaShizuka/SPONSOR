# Dreaming Hardware Sponsorship Configuration — Full Stack Deployment

> ⚠ This document outlines an extended full-stack hardware sponsorship proposal, combining portable semantic development, high-performance workstation simulation, advanced AI server deployment, and datacenter-level orchestration infrastructure.

**Standard utilization:** primarily focused on SapClarify and AI model bidirectional translation experiments, as well as experimental development of Signal as a CUDA-native path execution language, evaluating the feasibility of high-throughput deterministic logical path computation using GPU tensor cores.  

**Non-standard exploratory use cases:** include diverse experimental architectures — for example, utilizing DGX as a physics-driven neural fluid computation engine, where ultra-large-scale multi-particle dynamics are modeled using neural network surrogate methods running on Tensor Cores. This allows AI-driven physical simulation layers capable of real-time adaptive convergence far beyond classical equation-based solvers. In this architecture, the DGX-based AI server cluster performs high-throughput neural fluid or particle physics calculations, while display rendering is offloaded to workstation-grade GPUs that synthesize final high-resolution visual output in real time. This experimental direction aims to explore the feasibility of neural-physics hybrid engines as next-generation physical execution models, with particular focus on their potential integration into real-time interactive game engines and advanced simulation-based rendering pipelines.
