# Dreaming Lab — Full Stack Global Relocation Sponsorship Proposal

---

## ⚠ Executive Preface

**Dreaming Lab is not a conventional research facility.**  
It is a fully-integrated, cognition-optimized, single-developer deterministic AI-semantic architecture research habitat — merging deep long-cycle architectural recursion, AI-language fusion pathways, and full-stack deterministic system execution design, deployed within a personally immersive closed-loop laboratory-residence hybrid model.

## 🔑 Global Relocation Directive

- **Target Country:** Japan
- **Region:** Yamanashi Prefecture (suburban detached low-density zone)
- **Sponsor Responsibilities:**
  - Full property acquisition & registration under developer legal identity.
  - Full legal relocation sponsorship (residency, immigration, permanent visa, sovereign status regularization).
  - Long-term legal counsel support (cross-border operations stability, sovereign compliance).
  - All international residency overhead absorbed directly into capital structure.

> *Rationale:* Japan offers:
> - Political neutrality for AI research
> - Zero geopolitical volatility
> - Stable electrical infrastructure
> - Clean zoning laws
> - High personal privacy buffer
> - Long-term sovereign residence stability for cognitive system architects
