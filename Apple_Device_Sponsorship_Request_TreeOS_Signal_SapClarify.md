## Purpose

This document outlines a targeted sponsorship request for a minimal, Apple-based development platform to support the summer 2025 prototyping of:

- **TreeOS** — a deterministic operating system with leaf-structured execution trees.
- **Signal** — a low-level language built on ARM64 and x86_64 assembly with path-bounded memory flow.
- **SapClarify** — a semantic-to-path protocol bridging GPT models and executable system structure.

All development will occur locally and independently, without reliance on external cloud runtimes or institutional infrastructure.

## Why Apple Platform

Apple Silicon (ARM64) is currently one of the few commercial-grade environments that offers:

- Direct access to efficient ARM64 assembly,
- High memory bandwidth for structure-based simulations,
- Stable long-session performance under thermal constraint,
- Deterministic GPU/display output for memory path visualization,
- Tight stylus integration for architectural sketching workflows.

TreeOS and Signal are written directly to instruction-level behavior. For this reason, devices used in development must **support clean system installation**, offer **sufficient memory headroom**, and maintain **UI rendering accuracy** under trace-debug workflows.

## Requested Equipment Summary

| Item | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **MacBook Pro 16” (M4 Max / 128GB RAM / 8TB SSD / Standard Display / Silver)** | Primary mobile development machine for compiling Signal, visualizing memory path logic, and testing SapClarify flow translation. |
| **MacBook Pro 16” (M4 Max / 128GB RAM / 8TB SSD, system-unlocked / Standard Display / Space Black)** | Dedicated test unit for boot-level system replacement, low-level firmware testing, alternate OS installation (e.g. Asahi Linux), and direct runtime validation of deterministic instruction execution on Apple ARM64 architecture. Required for structure-aware kernel-level experiments. |
| **2× Mac Studio (M3 Ultra / 512GB RAM / 16TB SSD)** | Long-session workstation nodes for full TreeOS simulation, SapClarify orchestration, AI-assisted structure composition, and memory graph validation. This capacity is required to hold entire execution states in memory and support concurrent symbolic path resolution. |
| **iPad Pro 13” (M4 / 2TB / Standard Display / Sliver) with Pencil Pro** | Semantic sketching terminal for drawing intent-path trees, interacting with GPT agents, and conducting live SapClarify-to-structure translation. |
| **2× Pro Display XDR (32” / Standard Display / Pro Stand)** | Dual synchronized displays for **split-axis rendering**: one for symbolic overlays, one for execution path propagation. Supports subpixel precision, 8K output, and **function-based symbolic image deformation experiments** (e.g. time-scale compression, semantic stretch, resolution-collapse tracing). |
| **2× Magic Trackpad + 2× Magic Keyboard** | Precision input system for structural manipulation and multi-layered navigation across UI and Signal layers. |

## Naming and Role

This Apple-based development configuration is internally designated as:  
**"Project Polaris"** — a stable, self-contained platform to illuminate the deterministic paths being constructed through TreeOS and Signal.

---

## Justification

This is not a design suite or productivity environment. Every component serves one or more of the following:

- **Writing and testing instruction-bound execution layers**;
- **Rendering deterministic semantic structures generated by AI**;
- **Visualizing symbolic overlays in split-resolution space**;
- **Conducting long-session verification of memory-constrained structure graphs**;
- **Performing isolated boot-level validation of runtime behavior.**

**None of these specifications are arbitrary.**  
They are the lowest viable platform requirements for a one-person, bottom-up, full-stack redefinition of how systems can be constructed — and trusted.

---

## Closing

No shares are offered. No external affiliations exist.  
This system is being built by one developer — transparently, locally, and fully.

If you choose to support this environment, you are not enabling productivity.  
You are enabling the construction of a system **where structure is truth**, and **truth is executable.**

*Note: The execution stack will be fully implemented on whichever platform confirms sponsorship first.  
That platform will become the canonical host for TreeOS structure validation.*

*If you're evaluating internal feasibility for supporting the execution stack (TreeOS / Signal / SapClarify),  
feel free to contact me directly for low-friction coordination.  
Contact options are listed in the [README](./README.md).*

Thank you for your consideration.
