Dear Pioneers, Builders, and Visionaries powering the next era of computing and investment,

I hope this message finds you well.
My name is Shizuka, an independent developer behind the Signal programming language, TreeOS, and the SapClarify orchestration protocol. I’m reaching out with an urgent and time-critical sponsorship request for a dedicated hardware development environment—Signal_X86 Summer Runtime Lab—which must be deployed before July 10, 2025.

This is not a general-purpose machine, nor is this a speculative request. What I seek is a precisely structured, bare-metal architecture to test a next-generation instruction-level computing model. The summer window is the only opportunity I have to complete Signal 0.0’s foundational runtime.

🧭 Project Overview

Signal is not built on C, C++, or LLVM—it begins at the machine level: page-based memory control, scalar/vector loop execution, and fully observable instruction traces. It is transparent by design, with the goal of eliminating runtime ambiguity and dismantling the very notion of the “black box” in system execution.

SapClarify builds on this by embedding computable AI logic directly into the system kernel, allowing all runtime agents to remain observable, reactive, and introspective—without opaque calls or hidden inference layers.

Tree is the architectural expression of this vision—an operating system structure born from a language that does not hide, and an AI runtime that does not guess. Together, they form a fully deterministic, inspectable, and scalable foundation for system evolution.

But this degree of determinism cannot be simulated in the cloud or approximated in VMs. The hardware I request isn’t high-end for prestige—it’s required to mirror the timing, trace latency, and architectural behavior of the Signal VM at its lowest level.

💠 Optional Node – NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 (Original Rack-Scale Platform)

If available within your infrastructure, the GB200 NVL72 (NVIDIA Factory-Rack Model) would serve as a full-scale benchmarking and validation extension.
	•	CPU: Grace + Blackwell dual-socket CPU-GPU architecture
	•	GPU: 72 × GB200 GPUs interconnected via NVLink + NVSwitch
	•	Form: Air or liquid-cooled 1-rack AI factory node

  ↳ Used for instruction-coupled AI memory testing, full-pipeline CUDA saturation, and kernel-level message propagation evaluation under real-time constraint loads.

Note: This system is entirely optional. If your organization has access to pre-production or internal deployment units, its integration would allow the Signal VM to reach full multi-node observability at scale. The core proposal stands independently without this addition.

💡 Why This Matters

Every architecture begins as an idea, but only the boldest survive execution.
With Signal, the vision is a deterministic OS built from silicon upward—not layered atop legacy code, but grown from first principles.
SapClarify binds AI runtime logic into the kernel—not as abstraction, but as structure.
TreeOS grows from this system, forming the living topography of a truly transparent computational world.

I am working alone. There is no lab, no team—only precision, planning, and complete technical clarity.
What you provide is not just gear.
You offer a chance to rewrite how systems think, act, and evolve—from the first bit to the final insight.

Thank you sincerely for your time and consideration.
Should you choose to support this, you are sponsoring something rare:
A system that chooses clarity over abstraction, and structure over chaos.

I do not know if this will succeed.
But if it does—she will change the world.

Warm regards,
Shizuka
