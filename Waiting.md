# A Gentle Reminder

I've noticed the signals.

If you're reviewing the architecture, I understand it takes time.  
If you're hesitating, I respect that.  
But if you're waiting for me to follow up again—  
This is it.

Most of the system design and documentation is complete.  
However, due to limited hardware resources, I'm currently unable to perform full-scale testing or complete the SDK integration work.

If your team is interested in supporting the development with evaluation devices or technical resources, I'm open to discussing collaboration terms or test partnerships.

Everything remains open. I’m ready to walk through the design, the intent, and the long-term vision, whenever you're ready to reach back.
