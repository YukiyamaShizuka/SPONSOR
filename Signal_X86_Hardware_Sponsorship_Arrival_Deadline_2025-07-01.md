# Signal_X86 Summer Development Environment – Sponsorship Request **(Hardware Delivery Required by July 1, 2025)**

This document outlines the full hardware configuration for the Signal_X86 low-level systems development platform. The goal is to build a transparent, deterministic execution stack for assembly-level experimentation, instruction tracing, and kernel module simulation under the Signal programming language runtime.

This is a formal sponsorship request. If accepted, please **ensure delivery is completed before July 1, 2025** to the following address:

**Delivery Address:**  
Baojing Garden, Lujiang County, Hefei City, Anhui Province, China  
**Phone:** 136‑9652‑5769 *(for courier use only; all other inquiries via email: shizuka@treeos.art)*  

**If the sponsored equipment has been shipped, please notify me with the tracking number via email.**
