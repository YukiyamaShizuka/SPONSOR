# Commitment to the TreeOS Project

The TreeOS system, along with its underlying components — Signal and SapClarify — is not a speculative idea.  
It is a committed long-term project. I will finish it.

The architecture, design philosophy, execution models, and integration flow have already been outlined.  
The only thing that limits its current implementation is access to sufficient hardware resources.

As an independent developer working alone, I lack the infrastructure required to:
- Compile and test across multiple instruction sets at scale;
- Simulate large-scale memory-transparent process flows;
- Build optimized SDKs for real-time interaction and AI integration.

If you or your organization believe this system deserves to be completed sooner and at a higher fidelity, I welcome collaboration, evaluation devices, or sponsorship partnerships.

This project will be built — the only remaining question is how far and how fast.
