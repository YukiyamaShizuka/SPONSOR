# Signal Initial Development Commitment Statement  
**(Summer 2025 Anchor Declaration â€“ Hardware Request Attached)**

---

## 1. Core Intention

Signal, as a deterministic low-level programming language engineered for direct semantic path control and memory lifecycle regulation, will **formally enter its live development phase in Summer 2025**.

This marks the irreversible initiation of the Signal execution structure, regardless of current resource constraints.  
Development will proceed under all conditions, including fallback to minimal hardware if necessary.

---

## 2. Hardware Path Dual Strategy

Development will proceed under one of the following two pathways:

### â†’ A. Self-Hosted Development (Guaranteed Path)  
If no sponsorship is available, development will begin on the current **MacBook Pro M3 Max**(surely not enough), with architecture-level simulation abstractions used to temporarily emulate x86_64 control structures, acknowledging performance and memory limitations.

### â†’ B. Sponsor-Supported Development (Preferred Path)  
If provisional sponsorship is available, the following three-tiered x86 hardware package is requested to enable clean instruction-level tracing, page table modeling, and early-stage AI integration validation.

#### ðŸ”¹ Lightweight AI Development Tablet  
- **Model**: Microsoft Surface Pro 11 (AI+PC) with Slim Pen2
- **CPU**: Intel Core Ultra 7 U7-268V  
- **Memory**: 32GB LPDDR5X  
- **Storage**: 1TB NVMe SSD  
- **Purpose**: On-the-go semantic path prototype editing & cognitive micro-adjustment zone.

#### ðŸ”¹ Mobile Semantic Simulation Workstation  
- **Model**: Lenovo ThinkPad P16 (Professional Configuration)  
- **CPU**: Intel Core i9-13980HX  
- **Memory**: 192GB DDR5 ECC Registered  
- **Storage**: 16TB PCIe NVMe  
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 5000 Ada Laptop Edition  
- **Purpose**: Rapid local semantic model stress-testing and architecture visualization runs.

#### ðŸ”¹ Full-Scale Architecture Tracing Workstation  
- **Display**: ASUS ProArt PA32KCX  
- **Host**: Dell Precision T7960 Workstation  
- **CPU**: Intel Xeon W-3595X (60 Cores,120 Threads) 
- **Memory**: 4TB DDR5 ECC Registered (16 Ã— 256 GB DDR5-4800 ECC RDIMM)
- **System Storage**: Samsung 9100Pro 4TB PCIe5.0 NVMe
- **Data Storage**: 2Ã— 15.36TB SK Hynix Solidigm D7-PS1010 PCIe 5.0 NVMe  
- **GPU**: 4Ã— NVIDIA RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell Max-Q Workstation Edition ( NVLink â€” N/A
)
- **System**:Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- **Wifi / Bluetooth**:Intel BE200 (Wi-Fi 7 + BT 5.4)
- **Purpose**: Instruction tracing, memory-bound vector resolution, and early-stage multi-agent simulation modeling under maximum load constraints.

## 3.â€¯Usageâ€¯Limitationâ€¯Declaration  

The hardware specified herein is intended **exclusively for the earliest exploratory phase of Signal prototyping and pathway mapping**.  
It is **not** designed to sustain comprehensive Signal execution, Treeâ€‘layer integration, multiâ€‘agent workloads, or protracted stability trials; it should therefore be regarded only as a **transitional sandbox for proofâ€‘ofâ€‘concept work**.  

All rigorous development, crossâ€‘layer validation, and longâ€‘horizon operation of the complete Tree architecture can be conducted **solely** within the purposeâ€‘built Dreamingâ€¯Lab and its dedicated laboratory infrastructure  
(**see**â€¯[Dreaming_Lab_Architecture_Validation_and_Sponsorship_Proposal.md](Dreaming_Lab_Architecture_Validation_and_Sponsorship_Proposal.md) **for the requisite facilities**).  
**The Dreamingâ€¯Lab is thus indispensable to the full realization of the Tree stack; absent this facility, comprehensive development, holistic integration, and conclusive verification cannot proceed.**  
Accordingly, the earlier the Dreamingâ€¯Lab is secured and commissioned, the sooner fullâ€‘stage development may advance in earnest.

## 4. Logistics & Delivery

If sponsorship is available, hardware may be shipped to:

> **Baojingâ€¯Garden,â€¯Lujiangâ€¯County,â€¯Hefeiâ€¯City,â€¯Anhuiâ€¯Province,â€¯China**  
> **Phone**:â€¯136â€‘9652â€‘5769Â *(for courier use only; all other inquiries via email)*  
> **Preferredâ€¯Courier**:â€¯JDâ€¯ExpressÂ only

To ensure an uninterrupted start, **please arrange for all equipment listed in this document to arrive no later thanâ€¯1â€¯Julyâ€¯2025**.  
This address will remain valid through Summerâ€¯2025, and delivery confirmation is welcomed via encrypted contact if required.

## 5. Finalâ€¯Commitment  

This statement serves as a **formal and irrevocable pledge** of personal execution.

**Signalâ€¯0.0 development will begin no later than Julyâ€¯2025, irrespective of external sponsorship.**  
Although my sole fallback device is presently an Appleâ€¯Silicon machine, I **earnestly seek to initiate work on a native x86â€‘64 platform** in order to avoid crossâ€‘ISA translation overhead and to expedite the earliest stages of compiler verification.

The inaugural build will deliver:  

- Semantic leafâ€‘node instantiation  
- Pathâ€‘oriented page structuring (64â€‘bit)  
- Manual memoryâ€‘block persistence lifecycle (`grow`, `live`, `fall`)  
- Scalarâ€‘mapped instruction branching (`.sgn` source files)  
- Vectorâ€‘scoped call resolution, executed without global state

## 6. Optional Sponsorship Pathway

For institutions or individuals wishing to support transparent low-level computing, direct contact may be initiated via:

ðŸ“§ `shizuka@treeos.art`  

Sponsorship will **not** influence design control or license ownership.  
All modules will remain under creator-defined terms, free of external lock-in.
