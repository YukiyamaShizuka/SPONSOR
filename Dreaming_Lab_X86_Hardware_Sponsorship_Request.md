## Standard Utilization

Primarily focused on SapClarify and AI model bidirectional translation experiments, as well as experimental development of *Signal* as a CUDA-native path execution language, evaluating the feasibility of high-throughput deterministic logical path computation using GPU tensor cores. This process requires simulating billions of *Signal* function execution paths to validate long-term runtime efficiency, statistical stability, and full execution transparency across diverse input spaces — demanding substantial compute resources to ensure exhaustive verification at industrial-grade confidence levels.

## Non-Standard Exploratory Use Cases

Include diverse experimental architectures — for example, utilizing AI Compute Nodes as physics-driven neural fluid computation engines, where ultra-large-scale multi-particle dynamics are modeled using neural network surrogate methods running on Tensor Cores. This enables AI-driven physical simulation layers capable of real-time adaptive convergence far beyond classical equation-based solvers. In this architecture, the AI Compute Node cluster performs high-throughput neural fluid or particle physics computations, while display rendering is offloaded to workstation-grade GPUs that synthesize final high-resolution visual output in real time. This exploratory pathway aims to evaluate neural-physics hybrid engines as potential next-generation physical simulation frameworks, with particular emphasis on their applicability to real-time interactive game engines and advanced simulation-based rendering pipelines.
