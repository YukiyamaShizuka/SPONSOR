# Signal Initial Development Commitment Statement  
**(Summer 2025 Anchor Declaration â€“ Hardware Request Attached)**

- *Note: This hardware request does not replace or reduce the long-term infrastructure planning previously disclosed for full Dreaming Lab execution. It is strictly for initial entry acceleration.*

---

## 1. Core Intention

Signal, as a deterministic low-level programming language engineered for direct semantic path control and memory lifecycle regulation, will **formally enter its live development phase in Summer 2025**.

This marks the irreversible initiation of the Signal execution structure, regardless of current resource constraints.  
Development will proceed under all conditions, including fallback to minimal hardware if necessary.

---

## 2. Hardware Path Dual Strategy

Development will proceed under one of the following two pathways:

### â†’ A. Self-Hosted Development (Guaranteed Path)  
If no sponsorship is available, development will begin on the current **MacBook Pro M3 Max**, with architecture-level simulation abstractions used to temporarily emulate x86_64 control structures, acknowledging performance and memory limitations.

### â†’ B. Sponsor-Supported Development (Preferred Path)  
If provisional sponsorship is available, the following two-tiered x86 hardware package is requested to enable clean instruction-level tracing, page table modeling, and early-stage AI integration validation.

#### ðŸ”¹ Lightweight AI Development Tablet  
- **Model**: Microsoft Surface Pro 11 (AI+PC)  
- **CPU**: Intel Core Ultra 7 U7-268V  
- **Memory**: 32GB LPDDR5X  
- **Storage**: 1TB NVMe SSD  
- **Purpose**: On-the-go semantic path prototype editing & cognitive micro-adjustment zone.

#### ðŸ”¹ Mobile Semantic Simulation Workstation  
- **Model**: Lenovo ThinkPad P16 (Professional Configuration)  
- **CPU**: Intel Core i9-13980HX  
- **Memory**: 192GB DDR5 ECC Registered  
- **Storage**: 16TB PCIe NVMe  
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 5000 Ada Laptop Edition  
- **Purpose**: Rapid local semantic model stress-testing and architecture visualization runs.

## 3. Usage Limitation Declaration

This hardware package is solely intended for **initial investigation and path-structuring**.  
It **cannot support full execution, multi-agent synchronization, or long-cycle system validation**.  
Such operations will require future-scale fixed-lab configurations (ref: Dreaming Lab execution grid).

---

## 4. Logistics & Delivery

If sponsorship is available, hardware may be shipped to:

> **Baojing Garden, Lujiang County, Hefei City, Anhui Province, China**  
> **Phoneï¼š13696525769**

This address will remain valid through Summer 2025.  
Delivery confirmation is welcomed via encrypted contact if required.

---

## 5. Final Commitment

This document constitutes a **binding personal development commitment**.

Regardless of support status, **Signal 0.0 development will begin** no later than July 2025.  
The early execution stack will implement the following:

- Semantic leaf node instantiation  
- Path-based page structuring (64-bit)  
- Manual memory block persistence lifecycle (`grow`, `live`, `fall`)  
- Scalar-mapped instruction branching (`.sgn` source files)  
- Vector-scoped call resolution without global state

---

## 6. Optional Sponsorship Pathway

For institutions or individuals wishing to support transparent low-level computing, direct contact may be initiated via:

ðŸ“§ `shizuka@treeos.art`  

Sponsorship will **not** influence design control or license ownership.  
All modules will remain under creator-defined terms, free of external lock-in.
