# Summer Acceleration Plan

This summer (2025), I intend to complete the first fully functional prototypes of **TreeOS**, **Signal**, and **SapClarify**, by writing, testing, visualizing, and evolving all components without external dependencies.

To do this, I need a minimal but powerful development and visualization environment. The tools listed below will allow me to:

- Write the Signal runtime directly on Apple Silicon using ARM64 assembly  
- Run SapClarify-based GPT orchestration locally  
- Visualize memory-leaf-path transitions with layer-based UI sketches  
- Maintain parallel windowed workflows for code, diagrams, and model logic  
- Interact with GPT via handwritten structure sketches and concept trees

This is not a luxury setup. It is the **lowest friction, fully deterministic development environment** I can assemble alone.
