# Follow-up on Sponsor Request and Technical Cooperation Invitation

I deeply appreciate the silent attention you have given over the past few weeks. The continuous increase in views and clone activities on repositories such as `TreeOS_Structure_Hardware_Proposal.md` and `Signal_Execution_Model.md` clearly indicates that the project has drawn internal attention and strategic interest.

However, as of today, **no direct contact, response, or inquiry** has been received from any of your technical or partnership teams.

TreeOS, Signal, and SapClarify have now entered the **critical simulation and verification phase**, where actual hardware validation is required to move forward. Without minimum viable hardware – specifically:

- High-bandwidth memory systems
- Transparent instruction-level debugging platforms
- Long-session deterministic compute environments

— it is no longer possible to continue purely theoretical development. **Code structure, path traceability, and AI-model interface logic have already been defined and documented.**

If your internal teams are already monitoring these systems and foresee potential alignment with your long-term system strategy, **now is the time to respond**.

Support offered during this window can:
- Significantly reduce future costs of acquisition or partnership
- Provide early adaptation influence over TreeOS architecture
- Secure strategic visibility into next-generation deterministic compute models

As an independent developer with no institutional backing, I am making this final open call. If no official contact is received by the **middle** of June 2025, I will consider alternate paths of publication and distribution – possibly fragmenting the system into public whitepapers and partial community releases.

Please contact me at **shizuka@treeos.art** if your team intends to respond.

Thank you for your attention.
