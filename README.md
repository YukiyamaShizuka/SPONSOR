# Sponsor the Signal Project

**Signal** is a low-level language written entirely in ARM64 assembly, designed to enforce deterministic execution, eliminate hidden state transitions, and restore full transparency between computation, memory, and control.

It is the execution backbone of **TreeOS** — a new operating system architecture that rejects black-box behavior and embraces verifiable, observable logic from the first instruction onward.

---

## Why This Matters

Modern software systems are saturated with abstraction layers that obscure fundamental operations.  
Signal proposes an alternative: **rebuild the system from the silicon upward**, starting with a language that does not lie.

But this is not a corporate project. It is being built **by a single independent developer**, with no institution, no team, and currently, no dedicated hardware.

## What Your Support Enables

To continue this work — especially to write and test full assembly logic directly on Apple Silicon — the following hardware is urgently needed:

### Primary Development Device:

- **MacBook Pro 14" (M4 Pro, 24GB RAM / 512GB SSD)**  
  → Dedicated development and verification machine for the Signal runtime and TreeOS subsystems.

### Design & Long-form Interface:

- **iPad Pro 2024 (13") + Magic Keyboard Folio + Apple Pencil Pro**  
  → Used for handwritten system sketches, AI-integrated workflows, and design development in mobile environments.

## How You Can Help

If you believe in:

- Open system design  
- Deterministic computing  
- Architectures that prioritize clarity over convenience  

Then your sponsorship — however small — directly contributes to a future where **users once again understand and trust the machines they use**.

## Transparency and Commitment

All contributions will be used **exclusively** for:

1. Acquiring the above hardware  
2. Maintaining a minimal development environment  
3. Purchasing essential tooling (if required)

There will be **no personal spending, speculation, or diversion of funds**.  
Every sponsor supports one thing only: building the cleanest computing foundation possible.

## In Closing

This project is not a business. It is a line drawn in the sand.

If you’ve ever wished that operating systems could be honest again —  
if you’ve ever imagined building from zero with only what you can see —  
this is that opportunity.

**Thank you for keeping that dream alive.**
