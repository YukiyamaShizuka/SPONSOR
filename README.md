# Sponsor the Signal Project

**Signal** is a low-level programming language written entirely in ARM64 assembly.  
It is designed for deterministic execution, predictable control flow, and full transparency between memory, logic, and process.  
Signal is the execution foundation of **TreeOS** — a new operating system architecture that rejects black-box behavior and redefines how systems can be observed and trusted.

## Why This Matters

Modern computing is increasingly opaque.

Most systems today hide memory management, scheduler behavior, and runtime decisions behind layers of abstraction and indirect execution.  
Signal offers an alternative: **a system where every instruction is visible, traceable, and consistent** — and where future AI modules can operate atop a clean, deterministic substrate.

This is not a commercial or institutional project.  
It is being developed **independently, by a single individual**, without hardware sponsorship, funding, or team support.

## What Your Support Enables

To continue development — particularly the testing of real-time ARM64 execution models and future multi-platform behavior — the following hardware is urgently needed:

### 1. Primary Development Machine

- **MacBook Pro 14" (M4 Pro, 24GB RAM / 512GB SSD)**  
  → Used to write and test native ARM64 Signal code, and to build early-stage execution models for TreeOS.

### 2. Architecture Modeling & Conceptual Design

- **iPad Pro 2024 (13",2T SSD) + Magic Keyboard Folio + Apple Pencil Pro**  
  → Used for handwritten logic modeling, system sketching, and long-form GPT interaction during structural design.

### 3. Dedicated TreeOS Runtime Testbench (Optional but Critical)

- **Razer Blade 18 (2025, RTX 5090 / i9 / 64GB RAM / 4T SSD)**  
  → If future funding allows, this machine will be fully wiped and used exclusively for TreeOS runtime trials and deterministic environment testing on x86_64 hardware.

> This system will never be used for gaming or personal tasks — only for reproducible builds, memory path tracing, and GPU-based system rendering simulations.

## How You Can Help

If you believe in:

- System architectures without hidden behavior  
- Languages that do not lie to the user  
- Clean, deterministic foundations for AI and OS development  

Then your sponsorship — even symbolic — directly contributes to a future where **users, developers, and machines share the same observable truth**.

## In Closing

This is not a business. It is not a product. It is a declaration:

> That system design can be honest.  
> That architecture can be understood.  
> That execution paths can be trusted again.

If this vision resonates with you,  
**your support helps ensure it continues to evolve — one instruction at a time.**

Any reduction in specification is not recommended, as it may invalidate multi-stage verification.
