# Sponsor the Tree Project

**Signal** is a low-level programming language written in ARM64 and X86-64. 
It is designed for deterministic execution, predictable control flow, and full transparency between memory, logic, and process.  
Signal is the execution foundation of **TreeOS** — a new operating system architecture that rejects black-box behavior and redefines how systems can be observed and trusted.

## Why This Matters

Modern computing is increasingly opaque.

Most systems today hide memory management, scheduler behavior, and runtime decisions behind layers of abstraction and indirect execution.  
Signal offers an alternative: **a system where every instruction is visible, traceable, and consistent** — and where future AI modules can operate atop a clean, deterministic substrate.

This is not a commercial or institutional project.  
It is being developed **independently, by a single individual**, without hardware sponsorship, funding, or team support.

## How You Can Help

If you believe in:

- System architectures without hidden behavior  
- Languages that do not lie to the user  
- Clean, deterministic foundations for AI and OS development  

Then your sponsorship — even symbolic — directly contributes to a future where **users, developers, and machines share the same observable truth**.

## Transparency and Commitment

All contributions are strictly allocated for development:

1. Acquisition of the listed hardware  
2. Purchase of essential development tools or licenses  
3. Sustenance and minimal health costs during continued research

No donations will be used for luxury, investment, or personal consumption.  
Receipts and progress updates can be transparently provided on request.

## In Closing

This is not a business. It is not a product. It is a declaration:

> That system design can be honest.  
> That architecture can be understood.  
> That execution paths can be trusted again.

If this vision resonates with you,  
**your support helps ensure it continues to evolve — one instruction at a time.**

Any reduction in specification is not recommended, as it may invalidate multi-stage verification.
